\section{Overview of the Candidate Architecture}
The system used in this laboration is implemented in either two configurations; centralized and distributed architectures. There are also two modes of operation, namely full and degraded functionality. Assumptions and modeling parameters for the two architectures described below apply to their respective configurations.

\subsection{Centralized Architecture}
The centralized architecture relies on the Central Unit (CU) to execute the control algorithm. The wheel units only contain sensors and actuators communicating with the CU over the communication network. With this approach the wheel units contain less hardware and become less complex, leading to lower failure rates.\\
\\
Instead the central unit becomes more complex, requiring more processing power and more memory, thus leading to a higher failure rate.
\subsection{Distributed Architecture}
